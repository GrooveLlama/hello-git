Life is all about hellos and byes

We don't know when our time is going to come so it makes every day precious

Live a life of a righteous human and be nice. It doesn't cost money to be nice.

Giving is a form a charity, the more you give the more you get back.

You don't become poor by sharing your wealth with the unfortunates, you gain more.

I am glad to have this job and the people around. 

Hope everyone gets what they want if it's good for them.
